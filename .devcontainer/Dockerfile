# There are 2 versions of the FROM statement.
# - The '--platform=linux/amd64' allows us to work locally, if the laptop is MAC-M1. 
#       However, this version has issues when running a streamlit app either in the
#       local(docker) env and also in the codespace env
#
# - The one without the 'platform' allows to run streamlit in the codespace env, 
#       However, this means that streamlit app cannot be developed via the local(docker)
#       environment.

# We would need to download datafiles from internet, during development. Hence
# at the least install CURL into the image. Another reason is that we will be using
# this to download the SnowSQL too.
