## How do i make a project "Codespaced"?
Use this project as the base code structure for the your project. What this means is that as a clean state, copy the content of this repo into your project.

Add new libraries, if needed based on [Doc: Customizations](Customizations.md)

For convienience, dont remove the [Doc: Running CodeSpace](Running_CodeSpace.md) and the "images" folder. But you can remove other documentations like [Doc: Customizations](Customizations.md).

Maintain the same project structure and ensure the artifacts (ex: python scripts) are stored in the appropriate folders. 

Try to use parameterization/variable substitution in your scripts, as much as possible.
